# Donorsync

## Dev Getting Started

```sh
npm install
```

You will need to create a `.env` file at the root that contains the contents of the `local .env` item in LastPass. Reach out to your POC if you don't have access to the `Shared-Donorsync` folder in LastPass.

This project used ESLint and Prettier to enforce programming rules and styling. Ensure you have plugins for both enabled in your IDE.

**Everything below is the default README from taxonomy**

---

An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13. Forked from shadcn to use Sanity.io / PortableText rather than MDX and Contentlayer (Contentlayer doesn't yet support Sanity)

Things Broken: Styling on the Docs page text and the Docs Toc (It actually works with the custome headings components, but for some reason they aren't passing linting/typechecks)

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

## Note on Performance

## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. ~GitHub authentication (use email)~
2. ~[Prisma: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/.next/server/chunks/schema.prisma'](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16117)~
3. ~[Next.js 13: Client side navigation does not update head](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42414)~
4. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)

## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?

I might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.

If you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the development server:

```sh
